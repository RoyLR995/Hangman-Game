# Hangman-Game

Hangman is a well-known game, and one of our simple JS projects. You can develop it in a jiffy using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Note that the main functionality is defined using JS. HTML is for display, and CSS does the job of beautifying the contents. 

Many methods are defined in the JS code, so it may seem a bit complicated, but you will realize it is simple once you read the code thoroughly. You can also run the code and see the execution line by line.
